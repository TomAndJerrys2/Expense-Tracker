# Project Tracker
A Full-Stack Web Application Built using MySQL + GraphQL + SpringBoot (Java) + Python for the backend and AngularJS V2 + JQuery for the front-end.

This is a Project Tracker for tracking and monitoring project changes, recording updates / modifications to the project such as feature additions, deletions and future additions.
Using Python to give in-depth statistics on a projects life cycle and performance. This application can be used along side various project developments.

The Spring Framework provides a fast and scalable application meaning it is built to be memory performant on all distributions of hardware. Various optimizations have
went into this project - primarily teaching me a lot about threads and caching. This application also implements a RESTful API which adds a wide variety of operations between
the front-end and the back-end
