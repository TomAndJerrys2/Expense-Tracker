# Expense Tracker

A web application built for tracking expenses and income - By using the latest data analytics and showing patterns in spending and income. This app allows you to create savings,
monitor your income and spending, convert data into reasonable formats (Excel and PDF Documents) and allows you to create a budget tracker in order to maximise your monthly salary.

By using React for the front-end - I have created a dynamic, scaleable user experience that is both browser and mobile friendly. Alternatively, this app can be downloaded as a desktop
application using the latest ElectronJS build. Whilst carrying out this project I picked up a number of skills such as working with Higher Order Components/Props and how custom React
Hooks are made and used.

For the back end, to keep it aligned with the technologies I am learning, I have chosen to use NodeJS for it's built-in libraries and features for backend and server development. All data
and processing in this web application is authenticated and uses JWT for token authentication. In return, I managed to learn about web data translation and encryption and most importantly -
How data is safely transferred between the front-end and the back-end of an application.

To Keep up to date with modern technologies, this app has an array of features that may appeal to users with little to no financing experience and in return; the App also supports a tracker
and global help system to inform the user of the best course of action.
